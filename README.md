# WayFindX

WayFindX is a handheld GPS receiver project developed by Bradley Johnson and Abele Atresso. The project aims to create a portable navigation device that enhances outdoor navigation capabilities for users such as hikers, adventurers, and outdoor enthusiasts. WayFindX provides essential features including position and velocity tracking, storage of multiple locations, and distance calculation to selected stored positions.

## Key Features

- Display of user position and velocity information
- Storage of multiple locations for navigation
- Calculation of distance to selected stored positions
- Intuitive user interface with control buttons and LCD display

## Hardware Components

The project utilizes the following hardware components:

- Arduino microcontroller (ATMega328p)
- HD44780 Controlled 20x4 LCD for display
- Control Stick for user input
- NEO-6M GPS module for positioning
- Power Switch and 9V battery for power management
- Additional components for connectivity
- Custom-designed 3D printed case for enclosure

## Software Interface

WayFindX provides a user-friendly interface with control buttons for navigation and interaction. The software is designed to display essential information such as current position, stored locations, and operational modes on the LCD display. Users can cycle through saved positions, select operations, and execute actions with ease.

## Challenges Faced

The project encountered various challenges including serial communication, interfacing with new ICs, soldering, and enclosure design. Overcoming these challenges required careful planning, experimentation, and troubleshooting.
