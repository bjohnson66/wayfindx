Synopsis of the Way\+FindX Embedded Systems Project.   

Way\+FindX is a handheld GPS receiver project developed by Avengers Assembly, consisting of Bradley Johnson and Abele Atresso. The project aims to create a portable navigation device that enhances outdoor navigation capabilities for users such as hikers, adventurers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Way\+FindX provides essential features including position and velocity tracking, storage of multiple locations, and distance calculation to selected stored positions.\hypertarget{index_features}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Key Features}{Key Features}}\label{index_features}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Display of user position and velocity information
\item Storage of multiple locations for navigation
\item Calculation of distance to selected stored positions
\item Intuitive user interface with control buttons and LCD display
